/*
    Example of error management using lambdas, immutable functions, and monads while attempting to read characters from a file.

    Please create a simple program that reads letters from a file and counts them accordingly.

    Please use the "Maybe" monad for error management. The following steps have to be implemented:

    1. First, define the Maybe monad.
    2. Then create a lambda function to read letters from a file.
    3. Next create an immutable function to read letters from the file.
    4. Lastly create a lambda function to count the letters in the file.
    5. Please use a main function to demonstrate the usage.
