/*
    Example program that performs an n x n matrix division (left division) using the Maybe monad for error management. We'll create a lambda function to handle the division and use the Maybe monad to handle potential errors.
    1. First, define the Maybe monad.
    2. Then create a lambda function for the integer division operation.
    3. After this create a lambda function to print the result of the division.
    4. Finally, demonstrate the usage in the main function
